###  
**Nov 10 -12, 2021**

Project conceptualization: Upon my work for the infographics for the website, I decided to explore the vaccine uptake and motivations about vaccination in Canadian adults with physical chronic health conditions - those most at risk during the pandemic. I decide to focus on the data collected in the last 2 survey waves (June and September) as that's when vaccine was already widely available in Canada, with 75% of the population fully vaccinated against COVID-19 ([Oxford Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations)).

Draft of the research letter sent to the colleagues: JS, KJD, TBP, and the PIs of the study: SB and KL. Feedback on the overall idea and vaccine framing requested.

**Wednesday, November 17, 2021**

Project stalls due to internal processes. Initial feedback from KJD, TBP is positive.
