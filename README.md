# CANADA: Vaccine update in adults with chronic health conditions

Repository dedicated to code and analyses done for a research letter titled *Canada: COVID-19 vaccine booster attitudes and motivations in adults with physical chronic health conditions*.

The **aim** of this work was to better understand how COVID-19 vaccine uptake can be improved and vaccine messaging better targeted to those with chronic health conditions that may be at highest risk for severe outcomes from infection. We explored attitudes, including motivators and resistance, about receiving COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses among Canadian adults with chronic health conditions.

**Method summary**: This study is part of the international COVID-19 Awareness, Responses and Evaluation (*iCARE*) study,3 a multi-wave, cross-sectional international survey of public attitudes and behavioural responses to the global prevention policies aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19. The analyses are based on two waves of *Canadian representative samples* collected in June and September 2021 (N = 6,009). All participants self-reported demographic information and were asked about the presence of any diagnoses: chronic heart disease (including stroke or heart attack), an active cancer, chronic lung disease (e.g. asthma, COPD), diabetes, severe obesity, any autoimmune disease (e.g. HIV+/AIDS), or any other immune-compromising condition (e.g. organ transplantation). Vaccine motivators were summarized descriptively. 

**Materials in the repository** This site contains analytical code(s). First the raw data was cleaned and prepared for the analyses. A separate file contains information that was included in the Table, and a separate file has been made for the Figure. The overall rMarkdown file contains code from the project inception, some of which might not have been used in publication. The project log describes the process and documents the steps of the work. All iCARE associated data is free and can be requested for further analyses or reproducible work.
